# Pacsun automated checkout using HTTP requests in Node.JS

In April 2021, Pacsun was rumored to launch the Fear Of God Essentials collection which was reselling on StockX and multiple other platforms for quite a bit of profit.
Unfortunately because of Demandware & App changes, this code does not function properly.

# Includes the Akamai Bot Manager bypass when it was worked in 2021
The URL "on/demandware.store/Sites-pacsun-Site/default/COCheckout-OrderSubmit" is protected by Akamai Bot Manager. 
However, for some reason, any HTTP method other than POST is allowed to pass through.

# Usage

## Install the dependencies

`npm install`
